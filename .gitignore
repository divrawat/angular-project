Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a MERN stack developer in Mohali earning ‚Çπ10k/month with a 1-year bond (Joined 1 May, 2025) . I‚Äôve done BCA + MCA (5 years total), built and deployed multiple full-stack web apps, but didn‚Äôt get placed in college due to DSA rounds or coding rounds. ‚Äî I genuinely dislike DSA.
Now I‚Äôm in a company with no real work or learning, there are no projects for now around 45 days. I‚Äôm self-learning Angular and DevOps to stay productive. But I‚Äôve heard even after switching, salaries here don‚Äôt go beyond ‚Çπ25k/month with 1 year of experience.
Should I start DSA despite not liking it? Or are there other ways to grow (remote work, freelancing, open source)?
Any advice from folks who‚Äôve been in a similar spot would really help. üôè
